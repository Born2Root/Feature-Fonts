# Feature-Fonts
Font experiments using OpenType Font-Features

## Friendly Font
The "friendly Font" is an self censoring intelligent typeface.
It automatically removes unfriendly words and replaces them with random characters.
You could ask, what the f(%k?! Which d*?khead comes up with that s$Â§t!
... well the nice thing about that solution is, that what you see is not reality.
The user sees the censored version, but underlying the real uncensored text is still available. That means you do not have to change the source text in any way.
Isn't that cool? 

Well, try it out yourself!
